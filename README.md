## INITIALIZING
If you would like to download the files and take a look at the code, please go ahead! All you have to do is download a copy of the main repository and then extract the files.

If you just want to try out the application just click [here](), it will take you to a live version hosted by Github Pages.

## CONTRIBUTING
pls help
if you can, thanks in advance
just post bugs, issues, or make branches with fixes and changes for the better

## GAME
More about the game here. The rules are very simple. All you have to do is match the correct card. There is no limit to how fast you can match the cards because as soon as you attempt a match, it clears the cards it checks for matching. That way you can try to do it as fast as possible. 

Time does not affect rank, but the amount of turns does, so be careful.

Once you win, you are greeted with a victory screen and a record of your time.

To reset the table, time, and rank, just click the redo arrow in the bottom right corner of your screen.

## ISSUES / BUGS

I have yet to find a bug or issue, it looks like i accidently fixed most of the things that were bugging me. My only concern is how it looks on mobile devices. Most will look REALLY good, but some devices with smaller resolutions might not look or work as well. 

If you find problems concerning the media queries, please report them in repository's issues.
